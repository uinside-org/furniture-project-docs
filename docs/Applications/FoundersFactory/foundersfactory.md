We've developed an AI-powered platform with multi-agent architecture that transforms the entire furniture creation process:
Our conversational interface translates customer needs directly into design concepts
Our physics-based AI engine ensures designs are structurally sound and manufacturable
Real-time 3D visualization allows immediate adjustments without specialized skills
Automated documentation generator converts approved designs into factory-ready files, reducing documentation costs from $500 to $0.50 per project
Direct integration with local manufacturers eliminates intermediaries
This end-to-end solution reduces the 8+ week process to days while making custom furniture as affordable as mass-produced options.

Please provide a few bullets on your current traction (monthly revenue, users, pilots etc) (max 100 words) This question is required.*
• Completed R&D phase confirming technical feasibility of our multi-agent AI architecture
• Developed working prototype demonstrating core functionality
• Created functioning mobile scanning application for space measurement
• Established initial discussions with 2 world leaders of industry (Blum and Kronaspan) and 3 furniture manufacturers (€10M+ annual revenue each) who expressed interest in piloting, 
• Prepared data collection infrastructure for 3,000+ designs in upcoming pilot phase
• Technical validation confirms 80% potential reduction in documentation costs
