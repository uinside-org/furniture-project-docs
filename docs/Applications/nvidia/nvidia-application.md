We transform furniture design and manufacturing with an AI-powered platform connecting consumers directly to manufacturers. Our system automates design processes and generates production-ready documentation, reducing costs by 30-35% and delivery times from 8 weeks to 1 week.
We target mid-sized furniture manufacturers ($5-50M revenue) and eventually consumers seeking custom furniture. Unlike CAD systems requiring technical expertise or basic configurators with limited options, our end-to-end solution makes custom furniture as efficient as mass production.
We plan to leverage NVIDIA Omniverse for creating custom physics simulations, training computer vision models for spatial recognition, and enabling real-time 3D visualization of furniture designs. This will allow us to accurately model material properties, optimize structural integrity, and provide consumers with immersive visualization of their custom pieces in virtual environments.
