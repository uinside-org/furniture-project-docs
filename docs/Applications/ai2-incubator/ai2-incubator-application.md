### If you (or your team) partnered with us tomorrow, what would you work on? Why that idea?

If you partnered with us tomorrow, we would create a different future together:

Imagine Maria bought a beautiful new home. She needs a new kitchen, but nothing pre-made fits her awkward corner space. Today, she'll spend 8 weeks visiting showrooms, waiting for designs, and paying 2-3× more for something custom.

We're building AFUR AI to change this:

Maria simply photographs her space with her phone. Since she's been using our services, we already know her color and style preferences. Our system immediately generates a perfect 3D design that fits her exact measurements. Maria looks at her phone and sees her new cozy kitchen where the ruins of old furniture currently stand. Once she approves, our AI automatically creates factory-ready files that go straight to a local manufacturer. One week later, her perfect kitchen arrives.

We're starting with furniture because it reveals a massive inefficiency - custom pieces take 75% more time and money than mass-produced ones. With 2/3 of our team having dedicated most of their careers to automating furniture production, we're uniquely positioned to solve this. By eliminating this gap, we're making custom as efficient as IKEA. We'll even use their manufacturer partnership strategy but at a deeper, more integrated level.

But this is just the beginning. The same technology can transform how we create houses, yachts, and eventually any physical object - a truly mass-customized world.

Larry Page just launched Dynatomics in this exact space. He sees what we see: AI-driven manufacturing is the next industrial revolution.

We've built our MVP and three €10M+ furniture manufacturers are ready to pilot with us. This isn't just another AI app - this is how everything will be made in the future.

### How do you get to your first $1M in revenue?

Our path to $1M in revenue follows a three-stage approach:

#### Stage 1: Pilot Program (Months 1-6)
- Launch with 3-5 furniture manufacturers (€10M+ annual revenue each)
- Initial phase: Free access to collect data from 3,000+ designs
- After proving 80% cost reduction in design/documentation:
  - Implement our revenue model: 30% share of manufacturers' cost savings
  - Each manufacturer saves €100-150K annually
  - Revenue per manufacturer: €15-20K monthly
- By month 6: €45-100K monthly recurring revenue (€270-600K for the period)

#### Stage 2: Expansion (Months 7-12)
- Scale to 10-15 manufacturers using pilot results as proof
- Increase average revenue per manufacturer through:
  - Higher volume of designs processed
  - Additional efficiency improvements in production
  - Premium features for complex furniture categories
- By month 12: €150-225K monthly recurring revenue (€900K-1.35M cumulative)

#### Stage 3: Market Penetration (Months 13-18)
- Introduce direct-to-consumer platform where we collect fee per completed design
- Implement tiered subscription model for manufacturers based on volume
- Add revenue streams from material suppliers who benefit from our detailed specs
- Target: €250K+ monthly recurring revenue by month 18

We've validated this approach with three manufacturers already committed to our pilot. With our team's deep expertise in furniture manufacturing and AI implementation, we're uniquely positioned to deliver on these projections and reach our first €1M within 12 months.

### How did you hear about us?

We discovered AI2 Incubator through our research on technical AI accelerators. When news about Larry Page's Dynatomics broke, confirming our market thesis, we knew we needed to apply immediately.
