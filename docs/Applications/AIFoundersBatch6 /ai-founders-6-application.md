# AI Founders Batch 6 Application Form

## Personal Information
- **First Name:** Eduard
- **Last Name:** Izgorodin
- **E-mail address:** izgorodin@me.com
- **Phone number:** +351914550905

## Startup Information
- **Name of startup:** Furniture AI (stealth mode)
- **Website:** https://cirqus.de
- **City where your startup is currently located:** Funchal, Bratislava
- **Country where your startup is currently located:** Portugal, Slovakia

## Your Startup Project
- **Main industries in which your startup operates:** Circular Economy, Industry 4.0 & Manufacturing, Company Management and Productivity, Creative Arts and Design, Built Environment

- **Describe what your startup does in <100 characters:**
  Connection consumers directly with furniture manufacturers through automated design & production

- **Please describe your product/service:**
  We're building an AI platform that transforms how custom furniture is designed and produced.
  Imagine Sarah, who needs a kitchen but finds standard options don't fit her space. Today, she must:

  Visit showrooms (2-3 weeks)
  Wait for professional design (2-3 weeks)
  Approve documentation (1-2 weeks)
  Wait for production/delivery (6-8 weeks)

  With AFUR AI:

  Sarah describes her needs to our AI assistant
  The system generates designs that perfectly fit her space
  She visualizes and modifies in real-time
  Once approved, AI generates complete manufacturing documentation
  Local factory receives CNC-ready files, building her kitchen in days

  For manufacturers, we eliminate engineering workload and errors while increasing capacity utilization.
  Current status: Working MVP

- **If you are aware of any competition, who are they, and what makes your solution different (USP's)?**
  Our main competitors fall into four categories:

  **Traditional CAD/CAM systems** (Autodesk Fusion, 20-20 Technologies, KitchenDraw):
  - Require weeks of training and professional operators
  - Create a bottleneck requiring specialized designers
  - Disconnected from manufacturing systems
  - Cannot scale to serve consumers directly

  **Online configurators and D2C furniture platforms** (IKEA Kitchen Planner, Tylko.com):
  - Limited by predefined modules and configurations
  - Primitive visualization capabilities
  - Cannot support true custom manufacturing
  - Lack production documentation automation

  **AI-driven manufacturing optimization platforms** (Dynatomics, Atomic Industries, SuperDesign):
  - Focused primarily on manufacturing optimization rather than consumer experience
  - Still require significant manufacturing expertise to operate
  - Target industrial-scale production with expensive infrastructure requirements
  - Limited consumer-facing interfaces and accessibility
  - Dynatomics (Larry Page's stealth startup) is developing similar technology but focused on manufacturing optimization without direct consumer connection

  **Next-gen interior design platforms** (AiHouse, Interior.ai, Planner 5D AI):
  - Strong visualization and consumer-facing capabilities
  - Limited manufacturing integration and documentation generation
  - Focus on design aesthetics rather than manufacturability
  - No direct connection to local production facilities
  - Lack physics-based validation for structural integrity
  
  Our USPs:
  1. End-to-end solution connecting consumer needs directly to production-ready files
  2. Physics-based AI engine ensuring designs are manufacturable and ergonomic
  3. Elimination of the traditional workflow that causes 75% inefficiency in the industry
  4. Multi-agent architecture that makes thousands of design decisions in seconds
  5. Automated production documentation reducing costs from $500 to $0.5 per project
  6. Democratizing custom furniture design while maintaining quality standards

- **What is the product stage of your solution?**
  MVP / Prototype

- **Is your solution Language Model based or Agent-based?**
  Agent-based

- **What role does AI play within your solution?**
  AI serves as the core intelligence across our platform through a multi-agent architecture:
  
  1. **Conversational Interface Agent:** Our specialized chatbot guides users through complex multi-stage furniture design processes, trained on domain-specific datasets to effectively navigate the roadmap from initial concept to final production specifications.
  
  2. **Emotional Intelligence System:** We've developed an emotion analysis engine that identifies 28 emotional patterns in text (currently utilizing 7 primary patterns), enabling the system to better understand user intent, detect nuanced commands, and adapt responses based on user satisfaction.
  
  3. **Decision-Making & Execution Framework:** Two interconnected agents form our operational core - a decision-making agent that determines appropriate actions based on user requirements, and a command execution agent that implements these decisions through our platform.
  
  Additionally, we employ AI systems for 3D object manipulation, specification generation, data processing, and manufacturing preparation. This multi-agent approach creates a cohesive system that bridges the gap between consumer needs and manufacturing requirements, continually improving through real-world usage patterns.

- **Is your startup incorporated? If so, what is your company's legal form?**
  We are currently in stealth mode, operating as a project team. We plan to formally incorporate as we enter the accelerator program.

- **If you have not founded a company yet, when do you plan to initiate the registration process?**
  We plan to initiate the registration process within the first month of the accelerator program to support our pilot partnerships with furniture manufacturers.

## Traction
- **Describe your traction so far:**
  We have developed a working MVP that demonstrates our AI-driven furniture design capabilities. We have established initial discussions with 3 furniture manufacturers (each with €10M+ annual revenue) who have expressed interest in our pilot program. Our technology has been validated through internal testing with over 200 sample furniture design scenarios. We are currently preparing for our first pilot implementation where we plan to collect data from 3000+ designs to further train our AI models and optimize processes.

  1. Complete the initial MVP for our AI Designer Assistant with real-time 3D visualization capabilities
  2. Secure formal pilot agreements with 3-5 furniture manufacturers with €10M+ annual revenue
  3. Implement data collection systems to capture and analyze at least 1,000 furniture designs
  4. Develop and test the automated documentation system that reduces documentation costs by 80%
  5. Create a detailed go-to-market strategy with pricing model validated through manufacturer feedback
  6. Establish our revenue model based on 30% share of manufacturers' cost reduction
  7. Prepare for our first paid pilots to start immediately after the program
  8. Develop a comprehensive exhibition plan and materials for Interzum 2025 (May 20-23 in Cologne, Germany), the world's leading trade fair for furniture production and interior design, to showcase our technology to global manufacturers and industry leaders
