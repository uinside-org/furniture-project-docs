# AFUR AI: AI Systems for Furniture Design and Production

## Project Overview

The "AFUR AI" project aims to create an innovative platform based on artificial intelligence for the revolutionary transformation of the furniture design and production process. The main goal is to eliminate inefficiency in the furniture production value chain (up to 75% according to estimates), connecting end consumers directly with manufacturers through an intelligent system of automated design and documentation.

## Vision and Mission

**Vision**: To enable people to shape the physical world as easily as the digital one.

**Mission**: Using the power of artificial intelligence and big data to create true mass customization, making personalized solutions as efficient as mass production.

## Market Problem

In the current furniture market model, there is a significant efficiency gap:
- **Mass production**: One solution for millions of products, 85-90% efficiency
- **Individual production**: Each product requires thousands of decisions, 25-30% efficiency

This inefficiency creates ideal conditions for market transformation. Before AI, this gap was insurmountable; now it's just a barrier that can be overcome.

## Market Potential

Current inefficiency of 75% creates ideal conditions for market transformation. In 2025-2027, a window of opportunity opens for the transition to truly digital production â€” the "Xerox moment" for the furniture industry that happens "once in 100 years".

## Project Hypotheses

1. Furniture buyers will be happy to design furniture through a chat interface, complemented by a self-completing project page, as it is simpler, faster, more convenient, and more visual.

2. Users will use our system to design furniture because AI design generation will be sufficiently fast, easy, and accurate to replace (augment) configurators.

3. Users will order furniture through our service, as automated processes for creating design and production documentation will speed up and reduce the cost of custom furniture production, and reduce the number of errors.

4. Users will be more willing and faster to place orders if they have the opportunity to visualize the future space with the help of AR/VR.

## Experiments to Test Hypotheses

Experiments will be prioritized based on a combination of potential impact and level of uncertainty:

1. **High Impact, Low Uncertainty**: Automated processes for creating design and production documentation.

2. **High Impact, High Uncertainty**: 
   - Designing furniture using a chat interface
   - Visualization using AR/VR

3. **Low Impact, High Uncertainty**: Using AI design generation instead of traditional configurators.

For each hypothesis, a detailed experiment plan will be developed, including defining objectives, success metrics, experiment design, and data analysis procedure.
