# AFUR AI: The Future of Furniture Design and Production

## Vision
> **"The best way to predict the future is to invent it."** - Alan Kay

**We give people the ability to shape the physical world as easily as the digital one.**

We harness the power of artificial intelligence and big data to create true mass customization, discovering that while we are all unique, our needs are surprisingly similar — which allows us to create truly personalized solutions with the efficiency of mass production.

## Market Situation: A Moment for Revolution

### Problem: The Great Gap Between Mass and Individual Production
- **In mass production:** One solution for millions of products  
  **Efficiency: 85-90%**
- **In individual production:** Each product requires thousands of decisions  
  **Efficiency: 25-30%**

**This gap was insurmountable before AI.  
Now it's just a barrier that needs to be broken.**

### "The Xerox Moment": Window of Opportunity 2025-2027

75% inefficiency in the industry creates ideal conditions for market transformation. Just as Xerox PARC invented the graphical user interface (GUI) in the 1970s, we stand on the threshold of a similar revolution in the furniture industry:

- **Those who miss the AI transformation will share Xerox's fate in the GUI revolution**
- **The time has come for a "furniture Amazon"**
- **An opportunity that happens once in 100 years**

## Forecast: AI is Changing the Market, Eliminating Intermediaries

### Cost Reduction up to 65% over 48 Months:

| Cost Category | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 |
|------------------|------|------|------|------|
| Production | 35% | 34% | 32% | 15% |
| Errors and Rework | 20% | 10% | 5% | 5% |
| Showrooms and Retail | 15% | 20% | 15% | 25% |
| Design and Planning | 15% | 8% | 10% | 10% |
| Marketing | 10% | 5% | 5% | - |
| Engineering | 5% | - | - | - |
| **Total Costs** | **100%** | **77%** | **58%** | **35%** |

**For a business with $100 million in revenue, the cumulative savings will be:**
- 2025: $23 million
- 2026: $88 million
- 2027: $153 million

**Delivery time reduction:** from 8 weeks to 1 week

## First-Mover Advantage:

Current inefficiency creates the preconditions for a market revolution, and we want to join the main beneficiaries of the revolution: customers and manufacturers of raw materials and equipment.

- **First movers gain a 2-3 year competitive advantage**
- **Opportunity to create a data advantage before mass adoption**
- **Chance to shape industry standards**
